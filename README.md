# OasisBot

Have added the logic to allow this to run locally and against a dev server
Have added 'shakeball' logic that lets you get a random prophecy, can list all, add or remove - this stores against a mysql db. 
Have added 'timestamp' logic that lets you type in a date and time and it lets you convert it to discord timestamp format to copy paste quickly
